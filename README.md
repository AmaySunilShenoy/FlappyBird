Getting Started
Prerequisites

To run the game, you need to have the following installed:

Usage


Launching


1.  Run the flappy.py script using python to start the game. You can provide the difficulty of the game as a command line argument.

For example:


    > python main.py hard

 
 The accepted command line arguments are:

    - Easy :         `'``e' / 'easy``'` 
    - Medium :   `'m' / 'med'`
    - Hard :         `'h' / 'hard'` 
     
2.  If you don't provide any arguments, the game difficulty is set to Easy by default


3.  The script will then run and launch a window with the game.


Game Controls
- Use the spacebar or the up arrow key to make the bird flap and avoid the pipes.
- Press Esc to exit the game.

Note: The game auto-restarts when the bird dies.
